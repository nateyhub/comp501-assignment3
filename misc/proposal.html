		<td> <em>Autonomous Vehicles was our topic of choice due to the opportunities it would provide to everyone in society, especially benefiting those in the disabled community. This would mean less transportational challenges for many people who may not have the capabilities or means to drive, but also a huge time-saving opportunities for everyone. AV's present some risks as well, however, to nearby children, pedestrians, and cyclists. We felt the impact on society in the past, present and future would be significant due to the conversation that can be had about the ethics behind AV's, particularly about user privacy and data collection
