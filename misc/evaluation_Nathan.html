                <p>It goes without saying that a future with autonomous vehicles raises potential benefits, but also various ethical concerns. Although they have the potential to bring many positive impacts and opportunities to those who are less able, there are also several considerations to make in regards to the possible negative consequences of this technology and what can be done to prevent them. </p>
                <p>The idea of privately owned self-driving vehicles initially sounds great - especially so, when you consider that the elderly, physically or mentally impaired, overworked (those who suffer from fatigue from long work shifts, for instance), and the drunken populations would be presented with the option to drive from place to place safely like most others are able to. This obviously wouldn't just benefit them, but other road users who depend on drivers to adhere to the law and travel with care so as to not endanger them.</p>
                <p>When you think more thoroughly about it though, you realise that with the good can come a lot of bad too. Artificial Intelligence is incredibly complex, so there are many obstacles to overcome as we try to improve it to the point where it is a suitable replacement for human judgement when driving. It's not an easy thing to trust a self-driving car with your life, especially when you consider the possibility of malfunctions which, in a particularly unfortunate situation or moment in time, could cause death if the rider is not able to respond quickly or well enough. There is also the classic moral dilemma to be pondered - if an autonomous vehicle had to choose between driving into an elder or a child, what would or should its decision be? Another hard question to answer is: given an accident involving two self-driving cars, how would you determine who, or what, is at fault? These are questions for which we collectively are unable to come to one “right” answer, as there is too much difference of opinion between people, so how could we expect autonomous AI to make a decision that everybody can be okay with?</p>
                <p>I believe it would be in the best interest of everybody to not get too carried away with the process of rolling out autonomous vehicles to the general public. The right approach would be to try and perfect the technology as much as possible first, in addition to making the best attempt at developing policies or something of a code of ethics for this technology, in order to lead society to a better future.
