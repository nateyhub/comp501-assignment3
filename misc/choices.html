    <ul style="font-size: 17px; line-height: 27px; margin-left:-23px; margin-right: 50px">
      <li><b>Choice 1: Implement Safety Features in Vehicles that are Constantly Updated</b></li>
      <ul>
        <li>Many autonous vehicles use maching-learning, Radar or LiDAR sensor data to detect obstacles nearby such as humans. The Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) also allow the vehicle to operate autnomously in a usual evnrionemnt for vehicles in which they are surrounded by other vehicles, bikes, buses etc.</li>
      </ul>
      <li><b>Choice 2: Cybersecurity Techonology</b></li>
      <ul>
        <li>Cybersecurity technology to mitigate the impact of cyberattacks and cybercrime. AV's operating system must use an interface that is scecure and protected in order to mitigate the effects of any hacking attempts or cyber attacks. Hardware and software sourced from any third party vendors must be well supported and protected from any potential gaps</li>
      </ul>
      <li><b>Choice 3: Protect Personal Data</b></li>
      <ul>
        <li>Data privacy can be protected by allowing the user to consent or not to data collection for the sole purpose of improving the vehicle's technology. Privacy and user agreements need to clearly stipulate how the data will be used and ensure the user understands and consents. Robust systems need to be in place in order to consistently update the user on their privacy and data use</li>
      </ul>
      <li><b>Choice 4: Develop and Adhere to Regulations</b></li>
      <ul>
        <li>Regulations and guidelines could be more catered to self-driving cars rather than cars driven and operated by humans in order to reduce the direct threat to children, pedestrians and cyclists. As most transport-related laws and regulations are based around human-operated vehicles and transportation, heavy research and consultation needs to be done to ensure the road safety of the AV and objects surrounding it.</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
