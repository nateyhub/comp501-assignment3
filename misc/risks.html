            <li><b>Risk 1: Overall Increase in Vehicle Miles Travelled (VMT)</b></li>
            <ul>
                <li>Vehicle Miles Travelled (VMT) Is a measure/estimate of the amount of travel for all vehicles in a specific geographical area over a given period of time</li>
                <li>Autonomous vehicles may increase the frequency of car trips performed, as trips that otherwise would not have occurred (for example: by those without a license, or the disabled) would now be possible</li>
                <li>The greater number of trips, or cars on the road, would result in in an increase in VMT and, consequently, and increase in traffic, noise pollution, and most importantly, carbon dioxide emissions</li>
            </ul>
            <li><b>Risk 2: Threats to Driving-based Jobs</b></li>
            <ul>
                <li>An increase in autonomous vehicle use may cause a substantial <em>decrease</em> in the demand for bus, taxi and trucking services</li>
                <li>This drop would mean the loss of jobs for those who depend on driving for income (same effect as automated checkouts on retail worker demand)</li>
            </ul>
            <li><b>Risk 3: Threats to Children, Pedestrians, Cyclists</b></li>
            <ul>
                <li>Again considering the negative impact that is increased traffic, the lives of children, pedestrians and cyclists may also be endangered as a consequence</li>
                <li>Car-centric cities (cities that are built in such a way that cars or buses are the only viable methods of transportation) already pose a threat on the lives of pedestrians and cylists. This is due to the lack of sidewalks and bike lanes, and the large flows of fast-travelling vehicle traffic</li>
                <li>An increase in trafic would obviously, in turn, create more danger for non-drivers</li>
                <li>Driverless transport can provide careless parents with the opportunity to send their children off to various destinations without proper parental superivison that would otherwise be required had the parents needed to drive the car themselves</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
