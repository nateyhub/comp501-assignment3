              <p>When the topic of Autonomous Vehicles is addressed the idea of ethics- the standard of what is believed to be right and wrong is a huge factor that needs to be taken into consideration.</p>
              <p>Some ethical issues we face with AV's are Cyber Hacking, and user privacy/data collection being at risk. As most Autonomous Vehicles require third party software and hardware components in order to manufacture the cars, the vulnerability for Cyberhackers to perpetrate software systems and take control of these systems is high. Thankfully, there are Professional Codes of Conduct to help combat some of these issues users may face. The IEEE- CS SE Code of Ethics helps ensure the Software Engineers are consistently acting in the best interest of the public and that they always promote and ethical approach to their profession (Gotterbarn, D., Miller, K., & Rogerson, S. (1999).</p>
              <p>My recommendation would be to refresh and update these codes of conduct to specifically target Cyberhacking, and user privacy. As what is ethical varies for each individual, updating the current laws and regulations would significantly help reduce these ethical issues that can be encountered with the development of Autonomous Vehicles.</p>
              
              <p>Autonomous Vehicles do provide opportunities to the general public by saving time by analaysing the best driving routes in real time as well as being connected to a Network with other AV's. They provide the disabled community with a lot of benefits and gives them more independence transport wise without reliance on caretakers to get to any appointments as well as future jobs. </p>
              <p>Personally, I believe the right infrastructure, laws/regulations and Cybersecurity measures need to be undertaken in order for Autonomous Vehicles to be technology that is Ethical and positive for our communities and individuals. Although there are many opportunities available with the development of AV's, in the hands of the wrong people they could have could have more of a negative impact on society then positive. If we had the suggested systems, and Cybersecurity measures and regulations in place I would believe AV's could greatly positively impact all those who use it.</p>
