    A Three-step Strategy for Approaching Computer Ethics Issues (*)
•Step 1: Identify a practice involving information and communications technology, or a feature of 
that technology, that is controversial from a moral perspective. 
•1a. Disclose any hidden (or opaque) features or issues that have moral implications 
•1b. If the ethical issue is descriptive, assess the sociological implications for relevant social institutions and socio-
demographic and populations. 
•1c. If the ethical issue is also normative, determine whether there are any specific guidelines, that is, 
professional codes that can help you resolve the issue. 
•Step 2. Analyze the ethical issue by clarifying concepts and situating it in a context. 
•2a. If a policy vacuums exists, go to Step 2b; otherwise, go to Step 3. 
•2b. Clear up any conceptual muddles involving the policy vacuum and go to Step 3.
•Step 3. Deliberate on the ethical issue. The deliberation process requires two stages. 
•3a. Apply one or more ethical theories (see Chapter 2) to the analysis of the moral issue, and then go to Step 3b. 
•3b. Justify the position you reached by evaluating it via the standards and criteria for successful logic 
argumentation (see Chapter 3).
