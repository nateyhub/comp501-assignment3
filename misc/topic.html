            <h2>Autonomous Vehicles</h2>
            <hr>
            
            <h3>What are Autonomous Vehicles?</h3>
            <p>Autonomous Vehicles use technology to partially or fully replace a human driver- essentially be a self driving vehicle. It can detect its surroundings, obey traffic rules and the technology can be constantly updated and improved. It has the potential to completely revolutionise the transportation and technology industries.</p>
            
            <h3>Justification</h3>
            <p>We chose Autonomous Vehicles as our topic of research due to the risks involved with developing this technology, including threats to the public in the case of the AI's potential to misidentify hazards, threats to data or location privacy, and sustainability risks from the materials it takes to produce these vehicles.</p>
