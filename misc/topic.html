            <h2>Autonomous Vehicles</h2>
            <hr>
            
            <h3>What are Autonomous Vehicles?</h3>
            <p style="margin-right: 50px">Autonomous Vehicles use technology to partially or fully replace a human driver- essentially be a self driving vehicle. It can detect its surroundings, obey traffic rules and the technology can be constantly updated and improved. It has the potential to completely revolutionise the transportation and technology industries.</p>
            
            <h3>Justification</h3>
            <p style="margin-right: 50px;">Autonomous Vehicles was our topic of choice due to the opportunities it would provide to everyone in society, especially benefiting those in the Disabled community. This would mean less transportational challenges for many people who may not have the capabilities or means to drive, but also a huge time-saving opportunity for everyone. AV’s present some risks as well however, to surrounding objects such as children, pedestrians, and cyclists. We felt the impact on society in the past, present and future would be significant due to the conversation that can be had about the Ethics behind AV’s such as user privacy and data collection.
