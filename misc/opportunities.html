                <li><b>Opportunity 1: Time Saving</b></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Since autonomous vehicles are self-driving, they can communicate with each other through a network, allowing vehicles to know busiest roads and avoid that traffic</li>
                    <li>Autonomous vehicles can analyse the best driving route in real-time, with approrpriate speeds and distances (even during "rush hour" where there is an increase in the number of vehicles on the road) in order to reduce traffic concerns</li>
                </ul>
                <li><b>Opportunity 2: Benefits for the Disabled Community</b></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>This would increase employment opportunities for the disabled community (approximately 2 million individuals), and save $19 billion annually in healthcare expenditures that resulted from missed medical appointments</li>
                    <li>Autonomous vehicles would help  disabled individuals with fulfilling their civic responsibilities and enjoy their civil rights to the fullest</li>
                    <li>New on-demand mobility for disabled people will reduce transportation obstacles and allow them to be more indepedent, as they would not have to wait for assistance from another individual.</li>
                </ul>
                <li><b>Opportunity 3: Road Safety</b></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>A majority of motor vehicle crashes are due to human error, therefore it is estaimted that fully automated vehicles can reduce the vehilce crash rate by up to a staggering 90%</li>
                    <li>Other positive effects related to road safety include: reducing the number of alcohol-based accidents, distracted-driving accidents, and accidents due to driver fatigue</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
